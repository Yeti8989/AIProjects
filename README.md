# AIProjects
This repository is dedicated to the assignment completed over CSE 3521, a course over Artificial Intelligence. Although these assignments came with templates, any and all work done in regards to the AI was all completed by me.

HW 3 is a puzzle sorter where the UI was done in HTML and the AI was created in JavaScript. The user inputs the numbers 1-8 in any order into the board and the AI solves the puzzle giving step by step instructions as long as the puzzle is possible. Different search methods were created as a method of learning the pros and cons of each one.

HW 4 is an unbeatable tic-tac-toe AI that utilizes alpha-beta pruning to make the AI as efficient as possible. The number of potential boards examined are displayed after each turn the AI takes.
